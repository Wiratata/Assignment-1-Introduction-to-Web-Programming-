            Hello! My name is Wiranata, a passionate and experienced motion graphics designer with over 10 years in the creative industry. Originally from Borneo, Indonesia, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects—from animated explainers to cinematic video edits. I recently moved to Calgary to pursue further education in Software Development at Bow Valley College, combining my love for design with a growing interest in technology.

            I believe that creativity and problem-solving go hand in hand. Whether I'm designing visuals, editing videos, or learning to code, I’m always looking for ways to improve and innovate. On this site, you'll find a collection of my projects and tools I’ve built during my learning journey. I’m excited to continue growing, collaborating, and making an impact through both art and technology.
